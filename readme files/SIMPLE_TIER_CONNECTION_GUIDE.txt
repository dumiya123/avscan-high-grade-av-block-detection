================================================================================
                    PART 3: DRAWING ORDER (STEP-BY-STEP)
================================================================================

Follow this exact order:


STEP 1: Draw the 4 Data Tier boxes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   a) Draw File Storage box (left)
   b) Draw Model Storage box (left-center)
   c) Draw Cache Storage box (right-center)
   d) Draw Session Storage box (right)
   
   Make sure they are evenly spaced and aligned horizontally.


STEP 2: Draw the main storage connections (3 arrows)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   These show where data is stored:
   
   a) Request Processing → File Storage (bidirectional)
   b) Report Generation → File Storage (downward)
   c) ML Inference → Model Storage (upward, dashed)
   
   Now you can see the main storage flow!


STEP 3: Draw the cache connections (2 arrows)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   These show what gets cached:
   
   a) ML Inference → Cache Storage (bidirectional)
   b) State Management → Cache Storage (bidirectional)
   
   Now you can see the caching layer!


STEP 4: Draw the session tracking connections (2 arrows)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   These show session management:
   
   a) State Management → Session Storage (bidirectional)
   b) Diagnosis Logic → Session Storage (downward)
   
   Now you can see the tracking layer!


STEP 5: Add the data loading connection (1 arrow)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This shows data retrieval:
   
   a) Signal Processing → File Storage (upward, dashed)
   
   Complete! All 8 connections are drawn!


================================================================================
                    PART 4: HOW TO DRAW IN DRAW.IO
================================================================================

DRAWING A DATA TIER BOX:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Select Rectangle tool

2. Draw rectangle (300px × 80px)

3. Format:
   - Fill color: Light shade (blue, purple, orange, or green)
   - Border: 3px
   - Border color: Darker shade

4. Add title:
   - Double-click box
   - Type name (e.g., "File Storage")
   - Format: Bold, 16pt, centered


DRAWING A CONNECTION ARROW:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Click Connector tool

2. Click bottom edge of Logic Tier module

3. Click top edge of Data Tier box

4. Format arrow:
   - Width: 3pt
   - Color: Blue (#2196F3)
   - End Arrow: Classic, Size 7
   - Pattern: Solid

5. For bidirectional arrows:
   - Also set Start Arrow: Classic, Size 7

6. For return flows (dashed):
   - Set Pattern: Dashed

7. Add label:
   - Double-click arrow
   - Type label text
   - Format: Bold, 11pt


MAKING ARROWS LOOK CLEAN:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Keep arrows vertical (straight down from Logic to Data)

2. Avoid crossing arrows:
   - Group related connections together
   - Use slight curves if needed

3. Align connection points:
   - Arrows should come from bottom center of Logic modules
   - Arrows should go to top center of Data boxes

4. Consistent spacing:
   - Keep parallel arrows evenly spaced


================================================================================
                    PART 5: ARROW TYPES EXPLAINED
================================================================================

DOWNWARD ARROWS (Solid, pointing down):
