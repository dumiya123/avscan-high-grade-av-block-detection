                    STEP 3: DRAWING ORDER
================================================================================

PHASE 1: Draw all 11 boxes (30 minutes)
   - Start from left (Input)
   - End at right (Diagnosis)
   - Make Encoder and Decoder TALL
   - Make Bottleneck stand out (thick border, orange)


PHASE 2: Draw main flow arrows (20 minutes)
   - Draw arrows #1-11 in order
   - All black, 2pt
   - Add labels


PHASE 3: Draw skip connections (10 minutes)
   - Draw 3 dashed gray arrows
   - Connect Encoder to Decoder horizontally


PHASE 4: Add title and legend (10 minutes)
   - Title: "U-Net Model Architecture"
   - Legend: Solid = Main flow, Dashed = Skip connections


TOTAL TIME: 70 minutes (1 hour 10 minutes)
